  <h1>Creative Coding Showcase — Summer School 2021</h1>
  <p>
    This site showcases the outcomes of the <i>Creative Coding</i> workshop conducted by <a href="https://johjakob.com">Johannes Jakob</a> and <a href="https://flxkpe.io">Felix Koppe</a> at <a href="https://hs-anhalt.de/hochschule-anhalt/design/uebersicht.html">Dessau Department of Design’s</a> summer school in 2021. Two students, Daniela Heinz and Jasmin Schmidt, participated in the workshop, and due to the small group size, the working atmosphere was very relaxed and focused.
  </p>
  <p>
    The workshop was designed for people without any programming knowledge and covered the fundamentals of creative coding with <a href="https://p5js.org">p5.js</a> and also a few bits of <a href="http://molleindustria.github.io/p5.play">p5.play</a> for gameplay mechanics.
